.Sh NAME
.Nm bsnmp-ucd
.Nd an SNMP module which implements parts of UCD-SNMP-MIB.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a module for 
.Xr bsnmpd 1
which allows to get memory, load average, cpu usage and other system
statistics. It implements parts of UCD-SNMP-MIB for this.
.Pp
.Sh OPTIONS
To activate the
.Nm
module add this string to
.Pa /etc/snmpd.config:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
begemotSnmpdModulePath."ucd" = "/usr/local/lib/snmp_ucd.so"
.Ed
.Pp
.Sh MIBS
The counters will be available under the following MIB:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
 .1.3.6.1.4.1.2021
.Ed
.Pp 
Or if the appropriate MIB file has been installed:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
UCD-SNMP-MIB::ucdavis
.Ed
.Pp
With
.Nm
you can extend bsnmpd agent functionality specifying arbitrary
commands in UCD-SNMP-MIB::extTable. To add new command you should add
following lines in snmpd.conf in
.Nm
module section:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
extNames.<INDEX> = <name>
extCommand.<INDEX> = <commandline>
.Ed
.Pp
For example, to collect lastpid statistics under mib
UCD-SNMP-MIB::extOutput.0 you can specify:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
extNames.0 = "lastpid"
extCommand.0 = "/sbin/sysctl kern.lastpid"
.Ed
.Pp
Note: Index order is important. Commands should be indexed begining
from 0 and without gaps.
.Pp When program finished, the exit status is available via extResult
mib and first line of output is placed in extOutpyt mib.  The next
time program will be run only after 30 seconds.

.Sh BUGS
When stopping bsnpd daemon, if extension command (defined in extTable)
is still running, it will not be terminated automatically. You have to
kill it manualy or allow to finish itself.
